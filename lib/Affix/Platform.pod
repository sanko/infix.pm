Affix::Platform - Platform and Feature Support Information

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Affix;    # Not 'use Affix::Platform;'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Affix works a lot of places but some features require certain combinations of OS, ABI, etc. For those complex
situations, various flags have been exposed.

=head1 Platform flags

You might need to know a little about the system so...

=head2 C<Affix::Platform::INFIX_Version()>

Returns infix's version as a string such as "1.5-current".

=head2 C<Affix::Platform::INFIX_Major()>

Returns infix's major version number.

=head2 C<Affix::Platform::INFIX_Minor()>

Returns infix's minor version number.

=head2 C<Affix::Platform::INFIX_Patch()>

Returns infix's patch level. infix refers to this as their 'teeny' version number which is usually C<0> and unused.
